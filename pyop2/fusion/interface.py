    original trace slice.

    :arg name: identifier of the loop chain
    :arg kwargs:
        * mode (default='hard'): the fusion/tiling mode (accepted: soft, hard,
            tile, only_tile, only_omp): ::
            * soft: consecutive loops over the same iteration set that do
                not present RAW or WAR dependencies through indirections
                are fused.
            * hard: fuse consecutive loops presenting inc-after-inc
                dependencies, on top of soft fusion.
            * tile: apply tiling through the SLOPE library, on top of soft
                and hard fusion.
            * only_tile: apply tiling through the SLOPE library, but do not
                apply soft or hard fusion
            * only_omp: ompize individual parloops through the SLOPE library
                (i.e., no fusion takes place)
        * tile_size: (default=1) suggest a starting average tile size.
        * num_unroll (default=1): in a time stepping loop, the length of the loop
            chain is given by ``num_loops * num_unroll``, where ``num_loops`` is the
            number of loops per time loop iteration. Setting this value to something
            greater than 1 may enable fusing longer chains.
        * seed_loop (default=0): the seed loop from which tiles are derived. Ignored
            in case of MPI execution, in which case the seed loop is enforced to 0.
        * force_glb (default=False): force tiling even in presence of global
            reductions. In this case, the user becomes responsible of semantic
            correctness.
        * coloring (default='default'): set a coloring scheme for tiling. The ``default``
            coloring should be used because it ensures correctness by construction,
            based on the execution mode (sequential, openmp, mpi, mixed). So this
            should be changed only if totally confident with what is going on.
            Possible values are default, rand, omp; these are documented in detail
            in the documentation of the SLOPE library.
        * explicit (default=None): an iterator of 3-tuples (f, l, ts), each 3-tuple
            indicating a sub-sequence of loops to be inspected. ``f`` and ``l``
            represent, respectively, the first and last loop index of the sequence;
            ``ts`` is the tile size for the sequence.
        * ignore_war: (default=False) inform SLOPE that inspection doesn't need
            to care about write-after-read dependencies.
        * log (default=False): output inspector and loop chain info to a file.
        * use_glb_maps (default=False): when tiling, use the global maps provided by
            PyOP2, rather than the ones constructed by SLOPE.
        * use_prefetch (default=False): when tiling, try to prefetch the next iteration.
